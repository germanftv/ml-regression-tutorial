You will be running through the workshop in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) using the Jupyter extension to interact with Jupyter Notebooks. Each time you open a new Jupyter Notebook, you will need to select the kernel (specify the virtual environment to use).

- Start by opening up the [`notebooks/0-check_your_env.ipynb`](../notebooks/0-check_your_env.ipynb) notebook and clicking the **Select Kernel** button at the top right:

- Select the **Python Environments...** option:

- Select the **ml-regression-tutorial** option (the Python version can vary):

- Use `ml-regression-tutorial` for all subsequent notebooks. Note that you can close the bottom panel (**TERMINAL**) for more space.
